Heiken Ashi overview

> make it easier to identify the prevailing trend by reducing market noise

Heiken Ashi swing trade method
- heiken ashi reduces noise in the price action
- suitable for swing and intra day trading - not scalping
- candles show the average pace of the price
- each candle overlaps the previous candle
- helps you stay in the trade for the full move
- 3 phases
    - large body long wick candles in uptrend
    - large body long wick candles in downtrend
    - small body with wicks in both directions (consolidation)
- in a strong trend there are no wicks to the opposite direction
- when trend changes direction the candles compress to a Doji style and have wicks in both directions
- entry point is when there is no wick to the opposite direction ie. flat bottom or top
- only enter when the candle for the opposite direction has a large body - small bodies are indecisive/consolidation and may reverse
- when candle body is large the trend is strong
- when candle body reduces in size the trend is weakening
- place trade on first flat candle with Stop Loss belowthe swing low/high aiming for 2:1 risk reward
    - alternatively, if you have marked up support and resistance levels you can aim higher to capture the full move
- don't monitor the trade, let it run

Important
- the price displayed on Heikin Ashi candles on TradingView is not the same as it would be on regular candlestick charts. This is because the two types of candles are calculated differently, leading to a variance in the price points they represent
- market orders are executed at the current price, not the heiken ashi price
