### second order regression
- a technique to model and forecast non-linear trends. it fits the data to a parabola rather than a straight line which allows traders to identify potential changes in momentum,
such as the topping out of an uptrend or the bottoming of a downtrend, which a straight line would miss. Second order regression is also known as `quadratic regression`

#### Advantages and Limitations
The primary advantage of second-order regression over linear regression is its flexibility in modeling non-linear patterns. Financial markets rarely move in straight lines, and the ability to capture curves can provide more accurate and timely insights.

However, it's important to be aware of the limitations. Like all regression models, the predictive power of second-order regression is dependent on historical data and may not accurately forecast future price movements, especially during periods of high volatility or unforeseen market events. There is also a risk of overfitting, where the model fits the historical data too closely and fails to generalize to new data. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with other technical indicators and forms of analysis to confirm signals and manage risk.



Golden Cross and Death Cross

In the world of financial trading, the golden cross and the death cross are significant technical analysis patterns that signal potential major shifts in market trends. These indicators are defined by the crossover of two specific Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).

A golden cross is a bullish signal that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. The most commonly used SMAs to identify a golden cross are the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA. When the 50-day SMA, which reflects more recent price action, moves above the 200-day SMA, it suggests that momentum is shifting to the upside and a long-term uptrend may be starting.

Conversely, a death cross is a bearish signal that appears when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average. Similar to the golden cross, the most prevalent SMAs used to define a death cross are the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA. This crossover indicates that recent price momentum is weakening and a potential long-term downtrend could be underway.

It is important for traders to note that while these patterns are widely followed, they are lagging indicators, meaning they confirm a trend that has already started to change. Therefore, they are often used in conjunction with other technical indicators and forms of analysis to confirm a trading decision.
