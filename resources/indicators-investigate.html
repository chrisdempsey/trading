## Average Directional Index (ADX) — TradingView

#### Definition

The Average Directional Index (ADX) is a specific indicator used by technical analysts and traders in order to determine the strength of a trend.

The trend can be going either up or down, which is shown by two indicators which often accompany ADX, the Positive Directional Indicator, commonly known as +DI, and the Negative Directional Indicator, also known as -DI.

For this reason, the average directional index is presented with three separate lines, symbolizing each indicator. 

Each line is used to help assess a trade and whether or not it should taken long or short, if at all. 

The ADX indicator on TradingView does not display the +DI and -DI lines by itself, but you can use the Directional Movement Index (DMI) indicator to see all three at the same time.

## Directional Movement (DMI)

#### Definition
Directional Movement (DMI) is actually a collection of three separate indicators combined into one. 

Directional Movement consists of the Average Directional Index (ADX), Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). 

ADX's purposes is to define whether or not there is a trend present. It does not take direction into account at all. 

The other two indicators (+DI and -DI) are used to compliment the ADX. They serve the purpose of determining trend direction.

By combining all three, a technical analyst has a way of determining and measuring a trend's strength as well as its direction.
