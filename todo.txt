- [ ] change the Settings collapse element to be accessed via the main settings cog in the header
      - this should be a flyout with
          - application settings
          - current tool settings
      - need to find a location to relocate the Transaction Log to
          - the settings cog is unintuitive
          - maybe leave as a collapse element at the end of the page?

      https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/data/latest.json

- [ ] ISSUE - MSTR/TSLA - if sell at a loss, the system doesn't allow the actual number repurchased to be entered as lower than the auto calculated value - how to workaround this?
- [ ] local storage and data format issues
      - ideally need backup to single file, not tracker depenendent - pair tracker, portfolio tracker
      - useful to also backup user settings
      - full blown system is higher maintenance and security concern - can't custody user data
      - can this be done with JSON?
          - if so, can specific parts be restored rather than full app restore?
      - if above can be resolved, figure option for device sync eg. desktop to mobile
