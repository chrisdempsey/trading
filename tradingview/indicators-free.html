[DIP] Many Moving Averages
- Highly customizable set of moving averages. I noticed there wasn't anything simple, easy to use and customizable in the public domain so I decided to make my own.

Supports:
- Up to 8 Moving Averages ( SMA , EMA , HMA , RMA, VWMA , WMA )
- Each moving average can be configured with its own Period, Type, Source and Timeframe.

[DIP] EMA Band / Trend
- For those who like to have a trend indicator to base a market bias off of. Its basically a faster, noisier Larsson line that I personally use to double check my Short or Long bias for daytrading.

Bollock Bands and Scalper (to be integrated?)

Simply put, Bollock Bands is a long-term pair trading tool that gives you around 2-4 swap signals per month, designed for heavier swaps. It's made up of 2 main parts - the Bollock Trend line (tells you when to swap) and the Bollock Bands (tells you how heavy to swap). The Bollock Bands are very similar to the IA Confluence indicator.

On the other hand, Bollock Scalper is a separate indicator that is designed for 2-5 trades per week. It identifies local tops and bottoms, but doesn't see long-term price action, so make sure you're swapping much smaller amounts (otherwise you might end up on the wrong train at the wrong time). Bollock Scalper is based on a composite score of RSI, MACD and an EMA indicator, tuned to the same settings that James uses (or has used in the past).

Both seem to work well on the 2h chart using regular candles. But I prefer using MSTRx/TSLAx for Bollock Scalper, rather than normal MSTR/TSLA.

You can use both indicators at once when scalping (but I recommend ignoring the trend line if you do that, as it lags too much to be useful for these 1-2 day swaps).
