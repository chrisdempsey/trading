- build indicators individually, then merge into The Trding Suite
- indicator list
    - moving averages
    - bollinger clouds
    - auto fib levels
    - core momentum
    - dual linreg?
    - ZLEMA - mirror, remove box levels, anything else to add?
    - Lorentzian - any option for just the trend line, no flags (or at least disable flags?)
    - RSIz?



- standardise indicator shortname length - ideally 8 characters or include spaces eg. [BOLLINGER-BANDS], [AUTO-FIBS      ]

- add lassron line preset to MAs?
    - see DIP EMA Bandfor calculation


### MOVING AVERAGES

- [ ] add override for Period
      - it's time consuming to adjust individually when all are usually set to the same period
      - single dropdown for SMA, EMA etc. - if selected it should override the individual period set
- [ ] move MA type for the Presets group to same line as Presets dropdown?


### CORE MOMENTUM
- [ ] MR is clear signal - cuts through the noise of other indicators -- work on CM indicator to include with chart Layout and process


### TTS
- [ ] MACD lines - option for signal to be silver color for better clarity?
- [ ] can TTS MACD crossover triangles have tooltip on click like DCAS?
- [ ] BUG - Show SR elements, selections work except Pane Labels
      - separate into checkboxes like Auto Fib levels for neater display
      - fix the bug


### SUPPORT/RESISTANCE

- 12 inputs - timeframe?, level, support/resist (dropdown), color, thickness, style?
- dispay horizontal line instead of drawing on screen as it's a pain to group and manipulate these
- inhclude option to toggle line + label - or use price scale mark if it is applied, not sure it is as fib levels indicator doesn't mark price scale
    - also label text eg. TGT, ATH, ATH-PREV



### RSI
- custom version of standard indicator - option to toggle labels for bull/bear divergence, lines only is neater display but may as well leave labels as option
